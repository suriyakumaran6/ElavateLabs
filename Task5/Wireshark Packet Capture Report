Wireshark Packet Capture Report

1. Introduction
   This report summarizes the analysis of a Wireshark packet capture session. The capture was taken after browsing websites and generating network traffic for analysis.

2. Capture Details
* Duration: ~1 minute
* Interface Used: Active network interface (Wi-Fi/Ethernet)
* Traffic Generated: Web browsing, DNS resolution, TLS connections
* File Format: .pcap

3. Protocols Identified

| Protocol          | Purpose                                                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| DNS               | Resolves domain names into IP addresses                     |
| TCP               | Reliable transport protocol for data transfer               |
| TLSv1.2 / TLSv1.3 | Secures communication with encryption for HTTPS connections |
| QUIC              | Low-latency transport protocol used by HTTP/3               |

4. Protocol Details and Observations

DNS
* Multiple DNS queries and responses were observed.
* Examples:
  * aefd.nelreports.net resolved to a1851.dscg2.akamai.net
  * mail.google.com resolved to ns1.google.com
* Purpose: Translates domain names into IP addresses.
* Observation: DNS queries preceded HTTPS connections, as expected.

TCP
* Numerous TCP handshake sequences observed (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK).
* Example: 51044 → 443 [SYN], 443 → 51044 [SYN, ACK], 51044 → 443 [ACK]
* Purpose: Ensures reliable, ordered delivery of packets.

TLSv1.2 / TLSv1.3
* Several TLS handshakes occurred after TCP setup.
* Examples: Client Hello, Server Hello, Change Cipher Spec, Application Data
* Purpose: Encrypts traffic to prevent interception.
* Observation: TLSv1.3 dominates, indicating modern secure browsing.

QUIC
* QUIC protocol packets detected.
* Examples: QUIC Initial, DCID=12060b2487ba5309, Handshake
* Purpose: Low-latency encrypted transport protocol.
* Observation: Indicates HTTP/3 usage.

5. Insights

* DNS resolution happens before TCP and TLS connections.
* TCP handshakes establish a reliable connection before encryption.
* TLSv1.3 is widely used for secure browsing.
* QUIC appears as a modern transport protocol for faster web communication.
* No suspicious anomalies detected — traffic follows normal browsing patterns.
