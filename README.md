This repository contains all tasks, projects, and learning exercises completed during my Cybersecurity internship at Elevate Labs. 
It includes hands-on experience with network scanning, vulnerability assessment, ethical hacking, and security analysis. 
Each folder/project is documented with steps, screenshots, and scripts where applicable to demonstrate practical understanding of cybersecurity concepts.
