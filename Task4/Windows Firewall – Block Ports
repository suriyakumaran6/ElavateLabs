1. Use Win+r
Type"wf.msc".
2. Block Port 80 (HTTP)
Inbound Rules → New Rule → Port → TCP 80 → Block the connection → Name: BlockHTTP → Finish.
3. Block Port 23 (Telnet)
Inbound Rules → New Rule → Port → TCP 23 → Block the connection → Name: Block Telnet → Finish.
4. Test
For Port 80: Open a browser (http://example.com).
For Port 23: Run telnet localhost 23.
Both should be blocked.
5. Remove Rules
Go to Inbound Rules, find Block HTTP or Block Telnet, then Disable or Delete.

Port 80 = HTTP, Port 23 = Telnet.
Firewall filters by port, protocol, direction.
Blocking prevents unwanted access but can be reverted anytime.
