Phishing Email Analysis

Objective: Identify phishing characteristics in a suspicious email sample.

Tools:
- Email client or saved email file (text)
- Free online header analyzer

Sample Email: (In repo)

Main Features of a Phishing Mail:
1) Creating a sense of urgency (eg: "please let us know by going to this secure website and validate your email")
2) Unverified IDs (eg: The mail is only signed as "IT" with no official contact)
3) Providing links (eg: The text says “secure website” but the actual URL is unknown/malicious)

Steps to Identify if the Mail is Valid:
- Checking the headers using an online analyzer (eg: Mxtoolbox)
- Verifying the sender email address is valid
- Checking for spelling and grammatical mistakes
- Inspecting URL links (use whois to find domain owner, VirusTotal to check if the URL is malicious)
- Verifying with authorities whether the statements in the mail are true

Observed Phishing Characteristics
- Urgency to act immediately
- Suspicious or spoofed sender email
- Malicious link claiming to be a secure login page
- Minor spelling or grammar mistakes
- Tailored information (victim's name, role, or workplace) — indicates spear phishing

Recommended Actions
- Do not click on any links
- Report the email to IT/security
- Reset passwords if any credentials were entered
- Educate users about phishing characteristics to prevent future attacks

Summary:
This report analyzes a sample phishing email, identifies the techniques used (urgency, spoofed sender, malicious links, spear phishing), and provides steps to safely verify and respond.
