# Password Complexity Evaluation Report

## Objective

The purpose of this mini-project is to analyze how password complexity affects security. Several passwords with varying levels of complexity were created, tested using password strength checkers, and compared. The results were used to identify best practices for creating strong passwords and to understand how attackers exploit weak ones.

## 1. Sample Passwords Created

| Password Example | Complexity Level |
| ---------------- | ---------------- |
| `password123`    | Low              |
| `Password123`    | Low-Medium       |
| `P@ssword123`    | Medium           |
| `P@ssw0rd!2025`  | High             |
| `q*R9!vB7z#K2$`  | Very High        |

## 2. Password Strength Test Results

(Checked using tools like **HowSecureIsMyPassword.net** and other strength checkers.)

| Password        | Estimated Crack Time    | Feedback from Checker           |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `password123`   | < 1 second              | Too common, dictionary word     |
| `Password123`   | Few minutes             | Better, but predictable pattern |
| `P@ssword123`   | Hours to days           | Stronger due to symbols         |
| `P@ssw0rd!2025` | Centuries               | Excellent complexity            |
| `q*R9!vB7z#K2$` | Practically uncrackable | Extremely strong                |

## 3. Best Practices Learned

* Use at least **12â€“16 characters**.
* Combine **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**.
* Avoid dictionary words and predictable sequences.
* Do not reuse passwords across multiple accounts.
* Consider using a **passphrase** (e.g., `"Blue!Moon*Train$2025"`) for memorability and strength.
* Store strong, unique passwords in a **password manager**.

---

## 4. Common Password Attacks

* **Brute Force Attack:** Tries all possible combinations. Complexity + length increase crack time exponentially.
* **Dictionary Attack:** Uses common words/passwords list. Easily defeats weak passwords like `password123`.
* **Credential Stuffing:** Attackers use stolen passwords from data breaches on multiple accounts. Reused passwords are highly vulnerable.

## 5. Conclusion

Password complexity plays a crucial role in digital security.

* **Weak passwords** (short, dictionary-based) can be cracked instantly.
* **Moderately strong passwords** (mixed characters but predictable) can be cracked within hours or days.
* **Strong, complex, and long passwords** (with randomness or passphrases) provide protection against brute force and dictionary attacks, often requiring **centuries** to crack.

The safest practice is to use **long, unique, and complex passwords** combined with a **password manager** for convenience.

**Final Note:** This report demonstrates how small changes (adding symbols, numbers, and length) drastically improve password strength.
